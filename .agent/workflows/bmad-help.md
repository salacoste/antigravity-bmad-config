# BMad Framework Help

The BMad framework has been transposed to Antigravity with short command aliases.

## Agents
- `/analyst`: Research and Requirements
- `/architect`: System Architecture
- `/dev`: Implementation (Developer)
- `/master`: BMad Master (General Purpose Helper)
- `/orchestrator`: BMad Orchestrator
- `/pm`: Product Manager
- `/po`: Product Owner
- `/qa`: Test Architect (QA)
- `/sm`: Scrum Master
- `/ux`: UX Expert

## Common Tasks
You can run these directly, or better yet, run an Agent above and select the task from their menu.
- `/bmad-task-create-doc`: Create a document from a template
- `/bmad-task-risk-profile`: Assess risks for a story (*risk)
- `/bmad-task-test-design`: Design tests for a story (*design)
- `/bmad-task-trace-requirements`: Trace requirements to code (*trace)
- `/bmad-task-nfr-assess`: Assess Non-Functional Requirements (*nfr)
- `/bmad-task-review-story`: Review a story (*review)

## Usage
Select an agent workflow (e.g., `/po`). The agent will assume their persona and offer you a list of tasks relevant to their role.
